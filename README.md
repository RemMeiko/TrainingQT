## Configuration and code on GEC6818 board

This IOT wireless sensor system uses three-terminal cooperation to realize wireless sensor communication, Zigbee for wireless data transmission, GEC6818 for data display and control, and then uses the gateway to transmit data to the server, and the client sends a POST request to pull The data is displayed on the client interface in real time. This time, C++ was used as the development language, QT was used to design the interface, and ImageSwitch and qCustomPlot third-party controls were used to optimize the interface and analyze and display data, realizing data interactivity and humanized operation experience.
